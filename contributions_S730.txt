Contributions:

Edvin: 
* RandomForest and Gradient Boost + very basic tuning of them and brief description of them. Untuned kNN, LogReg, GaussianNB. 
* Discussion about apparent overfit of GB and RF.
* Discussed the performance difference when using raw in-data between the ensemble and non-ensemble methods.

Karl-Johan HÃ¤llgren:
* Everything to do with kNN tuning in the report, including the final kNN code and test submission.
* Main writer of scenario 1 & 2 in ethics section, as well as large parts of analysis

Mohammed Al-Jaff: 
* Exploraty data analyis, feature selection and dataset preprocessing. 
* support vector machine classification + tuning of the penalization hyper param. 
* Wrote introduction, and SVM parts + Data analysis parts of the report. Contributed to in discusion part about 0.8 ceiling, why could be the case and how this could be adressed by expanding features.
